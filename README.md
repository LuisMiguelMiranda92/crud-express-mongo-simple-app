# My Awesome Project
Simple app that allow us to write and keep track of a list of quotes from Star Wars Characters(or anyone else).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, node.js, CRUD, express, mongodb

The Star Wars Quotes CRUD App is built using Node.js and Express. with EJS as the templating engine and MongoDB as the database. The application implements RESTful API design principles to enable CRUD operations. The project provides a practice opportunity to develop proficiency in server-side programming with Node.js and Express.

## Optimizations

This practice project has provided valuable insights into server-side programming with Node.js and Express. 
In future optimizations, I plan to refresh the page as son as a quote form yoda is replaced by a quote from Darth Vader.

## Lessons Learned:

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of server-side development using Node.js and Express. I gained practical experience with CRUD operations and learned how to effectively interact with a database.
